Computers have always attracted my attention since I was in the first standard. Gradually my fondness for them start growing and since then I wanted to be a computer engineer.    
    
I was fanatical about the algorithms and core computing stuff. My algorithmic fever introduced me to the realm of Machine Learning. I am exhilarated about how these miraculous artifacts have evolved and the inventiveness behind them.    
    
Hi, I am Mayank Mishra. I work as a Data Scientist at Wolters Kluwer. Earlier I worked as a Data Science Engineer at Infostretch Corporation.    
Also, I do organize the Pune chapter for PyData.
